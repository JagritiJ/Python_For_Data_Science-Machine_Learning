    "This module will teach you the basics of NumPy which is the fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy consists of a powerful data structure called multidimensional arrays. Pandas is another powerful Python library that provides fast and easy data analysis platform. You will also learn about 'Data Visualisation in Python' in a separate module."
